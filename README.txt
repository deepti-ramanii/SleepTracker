First, install Android Studio with all the recommended settings. Then, download the github repository. Open the code’s folder in Android Studio. At the top of the window, there is a toolbar with many different tool icons. The dropdown to the left of the green arrow should have an emulator selected. Any emulator works as long as it is API 24 or above (we used the Pixel 3a API 30 emulator). To run the app, click the green arrow (or press Shift + F10). A phone emulator will appear on screen. Wait for it to load and the app will appear on the phone screen. If it’s the first time loading the emulator, it might take a while to install the app and get it working.
Once the app has opened, you can click “sleep” when you want to record your sleep time. When you want to record your wake up time, you can click the same button, which now says “wake up”. A dialog box with pop up, prompting you to rate your quality of sleep. You can choose whether or not to enter a rating (the app will work, regardless), but we recommend that you do for optimal usage of our app! Once you either rate your sleep or close the dialog, your sleep will be logged. 
Once you’ve logged your sleep, you might want to look up stats or trends about the sleep you’ve logged. The bottom middle button with the graph icon takes you to the custom stats page. Enter a range of dates that you would like to see stats for (in the format DD/MM/YYYY). Click go and it will display a graph of the sleep quality, as well as display your average sleep time, average wake up time, average hours of sleep, and average sleep quality.
The bottom right button with the magnifying glass icon takes you to the recommendations page. It displays the average hours of sleep for the current week, and how many hours you should sleep each night for the rest of the week in order to bring your average number of hours slept that week up to the recommended amount.
